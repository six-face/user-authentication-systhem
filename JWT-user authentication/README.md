JWT(JSON Web Token) based User Authentification

Since I used [Redis](https://redis.io/) as a "control-list" of the Token generated by JWT(in order to manually terminate the session between server and client), so either you can comment out the code that related to Redis and choose another method to achive the same thing, or you have to install Redis and start it before you running this project.

Also, this project has no user interface, you can use [PostMan](https://www.postman.com/) to test everything(I will add user interface later, if i have motivations : P).

so, I assumed you are using Mac and installed Redis with Homebrew, let's runing the project:

```
brew services start redis
```

```
npm install
npm start
```

There you go : )
