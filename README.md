This project means to understand the differences between these two popular authentication models.

In general, the biggest differences are:

1. Wether to save Token in Server side(Session-based model will save token in server side, JWT-based model will not)
2. Ternimating session between server and client manually (Session-based model can abort session by delete token in server side, JWT model can not delete token, it will be there until expires once it is generated, which means technically you can not terminate a session between server and client)

But, you can say(or i can say : )), so what, i just wanna terminate the session even i am using JWT model, i dont believe that there is no way to go ~.~ !

Alright, you win, give us a chance, we can create a "control-list" stored in a "tiny && quick server", for example, [Redis](https://redis.io/), which is a in-memory data structure. we can save the token generated by JWT model in it, can check it before every request related to user authorization.

To ternimate the session between server and client we can just delete the token that we saved in the "control-list".

Soooo, actually, it's just a trade off, every model has it's bright side and dark side.

Hopefully, you will enjoy it. : )
